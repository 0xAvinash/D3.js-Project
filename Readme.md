### D3.js Project

- D3.js project that I wrote for a client back in 2013, open sourcing it now. And run `git clone https://github.com/Avinash-Vadlamudi/D3.js-Project.git`
- To run the project, install `nodejs` & `serve` ie., `sudo npm i -g serve` and go to the root directory of the project and run `serve -p 3000` and open the link in a web browser
